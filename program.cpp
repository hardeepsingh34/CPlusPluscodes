Data Abstraction is one of the most important concepts in DBMS. Data abstraction is the process of hiding unwanted and irrelevant details from the end user. It helps to store information in such a way that the end user can access data which is necessary, the user will not be able to see what data is stored or how it is stored in a database. Data abstraction helps to keep data secure from unauthorized access and it hides all the implementation details.
